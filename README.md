# TechMechinery_Internship
<h4>My Works at TechMechinery Labs as an Data Science Intern</h4>

<h4>As part of this project, we create a framework using Durable Rules to implement the following:</h4>
<h4>1. Rule-based re-enforcement learning for creating Knowledge Base for decision making.</h4>
<h4>2. Creation of dynamic rules on the fly and updating existing rules based on the learning.</h4>
<h4>3. Existing rules are updated and made even more precise while the learning happens over a period of time. New rules are added by the system automatically as well.
