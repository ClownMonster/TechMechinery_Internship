# TechMechinery_Internship
<h4>My Works at TechMechinery Labs as an Data Science Intern</h4>

<h4>As part of this project, we create a framework using Durable Rules to implement the following:
1. Rule-based re-enforcement learning for creating Knowledge Base for decision making.
2. Creation of dynamic rules on the fly and updating existing rules based on the learning.
3. Existing rules are updated and made even more precise while the learning happens over a period of time. New rules are added by the system automatically as well.
